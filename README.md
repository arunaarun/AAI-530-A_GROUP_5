## Project Introduction
The "Smoke Detection IoT" project aims to provide an efficient toolset for safeguarding lives and property against the devastating effects of fires using both traditional and advanced machine learning algorithms by working with the "Smoke Detection Dataset" dataset from Kaggle ( Deep Contractor,2022). The goal of our research is to perform such a task, while providing context on enhancing accuracy, speed,reliability and ethics.
